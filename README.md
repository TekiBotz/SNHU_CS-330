How do I approach designing software?
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  
  Working on a project in OpenGL has helped me develop several new design skills. For example, I have learned to approach software design systematically  and to break down larger goals into smaller, more manageable tasks. I have also learned to focus on user needs and to design software that is intuitive and easy to use.

  What design process did you follow for your project work?
  
  In designing my 3D scene, I followed a well-defined design process. This process involved identifying the goals of the project, breaking those goals down into smaller tasks, and designing each component of the software systematically. I also iterated on my designs, testing and refining each component until it worked as intended.

  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  
  The design tactics I used in my 3D scene project can be applied to future work in a number of ways. For example, I can use the same systematic approach to break down larger goals into smaller, more manageable tasks. I can also focus on user needs and design software that is intuitive and easy to use.

How do I approach developing programs?
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  
  In developing my 3D scene, I used a variety of new development strategies. For example, I focused on modularity and organization, grouping similar code together and using reusable code segments wherever possible. I also iterated on my designs, testing and refining each component until it worked as intended.

  How did iteration factor into your development?
  
  Iteration played a significant role in my development process for my 3D scene. I tested and refined each component of the software until it worked as intended, and I made changes as needed to improve performance and user experience.

  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  
  My approach to developing code has evolved significantly throughout the milestones leading up to the project's completion. I have learned to approach software development more systematically and to break down larger goals into smaller, more manageable tasks. I have also become more skilled at designing software that is intuitive and easy to use.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  
  Computational graphics and visualizations can provide me with new knowledge and skills that can be applied in my future educational pathways. For example, I can learn how to create interactive visualizations that help to illustrate complex concepts and data sets.

  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  
  Computational graphics and visualizations can also provide me with new knowledge and skills that can be applied in my future professional pathway. For example, I can learn how to create 3D models and simulations that help to design and test new products and systems.
